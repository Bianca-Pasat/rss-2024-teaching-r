## Teaching statistics with R

::: {.incremental}

* Many introductory (and more advanced) statistics courses also include instruction on using R.

* Many courses teach statistical concepts in lectures, then the practical aspects of using R in separate workshops with smaller groups.

* Including programming examples in a lecture environment isn't always easy.

## Code blocks with R Markdown (or Quarto!)

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# read in data
census <- readxl::read_xlsx("Data/Census2021-health-la.xlsx", skip = 4)

# get local authority map shapefiles
la_map <- sf::st_read("Data/Local_Authority_Districts_December_2021/LAD_DEC_2021_GB_BGC.shp") 

# calculate percentage that have bad/very bad
bad_health <- census |> 
  mutate(Percentage = `Bad health \r\n(age-standardised \r\nproportions)` + 
           `Very bad health \r\n(age-standardised \r\nproportions)`) |> 
  select(`Area code`, Percentage) 

# highest / lowest percentage
slice_max(bad_health, Percentage, n = 1)
slice_min(bad_health, Percentage, n = 1)
round(mean(bad_health$Percentage), 1)
```

## Live coding!

. . . 

::: columns
::: {.column}

**Pros**

* shows the process of writing code

* teaches students how to debug code

* demonstrates good programming practices

:::

::: {.column}

**Cons**

* Switching between windows 

* More pressure as a demonstrator 

* Hard for students to run the code themselves

# webR {background-color="#D9DBDB"}

## What is webR?

[webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/) is a version of R that runs in a web browser.

. . .

* You don’t need to install R.

* You don’t need to setup a server.

* It just works (even on your phone).

## What can you do with webR?

Lots of things!

. . . 

::: columns
::: {.column}

* Download R package datasets to .csv, .xlsx, ... on-the-fly: [tidyverse.r-universe.dev/ggplot2](https://tidyverse.r-universe.dev/ggplot2)

* Shiny apps without a server: [github.com/georgestagg/shiny-standalone-webr-demo](https://github.com/georgestagg/shiny-standalone-webr-demo)

* Create interactive, engaging teaching materials (that work even in lecture environments).

## Try it!

[nrennie.rbind.io/rss-2024-teaching-r](https://nrennie.rbind.io/rss-2024-teaching-r)

```{webr-r}
# set a random seed and generate data
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(100)

# calculate mean
mean(x)
```

## Adding webR to teaching materials

::: columns
::: {.column}

* Quarto
  * Combine code with text
  * Multiple output formats
  * *Next generation R Markdown*
* HTML slides
* Supports LaTeX

![](images/quarto.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Quarto logo" width=60%}

## Adding webR to teaching materials

Install the [webR Quarto extension](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr):

```md
quarto add coatless/quarto-webr
```

. . . 

Add the webR filter to slides:

```md
format: revealjs
filters:
  - webr
```

## Adding webR to teaching materials

Add a webR code block:

````md
```{webr-r}
# set a random seed and generate data
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(100)

# calculate mean
mean(x)
```
````

## Advantages of webR

* Write and run code without switching between slides and RStudio.

* Students can engage with code in lectures on their phones.

* No set up required for students (and easy to fix mistakes!)

* Use code blocks that are empty, have comments, or have pre-filled code.

## Limitations of webR

* Requires an internet connection.

* Not all packages available. See [rud.is/w/webr-pkgs/](https://rud.is/w/webr-pkgs/).

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
webr::install("dplyr")
```

* Not a replacement for workshops. Teaching R/RStudio/package installation is still important.
